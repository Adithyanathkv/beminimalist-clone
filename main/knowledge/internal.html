                    <span>here is no end to innovation in the skincare industry. All brands seem to be fighting for your
                        attention and twist the narrative each time to seem more appealing.

                        <br>
                        We're talking about peptides today! This is the ingredient that will target your skincare
                        concerns like Arjuna targeted the fish's eye. Trust me! You want to know about peptides. They
                        will excite and overwhelm you with their abilities. Peptides do not care about your skin type.
                        All they care about is hydrating, plumping, and fighting aging signs.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Peptides are gaining popularity due to their ties with collagen, and we all know just how much
                        of a celebrity collagen is. The popular belief is that peptides help preserve and boost collagen
                        levels, triggering anti-aging actions in the skin. But like the good, responsible people we are,
                        we will not accept a popular belief, will we? We will instead know all about it, aLL.

                    Are peptides essential triggers? Yes, triggers, but in a good way since they trigger collagen
                    production in
                    your
                    skin. But to understand this statement fully, we will need to get the science behind it.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Peptides are short chains of amino acids. Now, what are amino acids?<a
                        href="https://beminimalist.co/blogs/skin-care/the-role-of-amino-acids-in-skincare">Amino
                        acids</a> form
                    proteins that make up our skin and also other organs. Amino acids are critical to our body's health.
                    They
                    stimulate muscle growth, build proteins, regenerate skin cells, and give our immune systems an edge.
                    You
                    can't
                    do without amino acids, literally. These energizing amino acids come together and form short chains.
                    The
                    resultant formation is what we have been chanting for a while now, Peptides. Go a step further, when
                    longer
                    chains are formed of these amino acids, proteins are formed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The moral of this science being: amino acids and peptides are essential for proteins to form, and
                    these
                    proteins
                    are essential for our organs to form and function.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    What peptides do is important here. They ask our cells to make more proteins when the existing ones
                    are
                    breaking
                    down. In essence, peptides nudge our skin to create new collagen and other skin-strengthening
                    proteins like
                    keratin and elastin. The proteins that it triggers in your skin are responsible for its texture,
                    suppleness,
                    flexibility, and vitality. It is noticed that your skin will excel in all these qualities when you
                    let the
                    peptides in your skin.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    These powerhouses, called peptides, help your skin achieve that firm, tight, flexible, and hydrated
                    skin
                    that
                    you have been after for so long.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Maintaining the proteins in our skin to keep it intact and firm is important and very hard. It is
                    important
                    because, without collagen, your skin will have no option but to form wrinkles and lose its bounce.
                    And hard
                    because the proteins break down and get produced slowly with age. Environmental aggressors,
                    pollution, and
                    the
                    sun attack our skin, resulting in the breakdown of essential proteins.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    So, what we do is we put these peptides on our skin and trick our skin into making more collagen.
                    Serums,
                    moisturizers, masks, and many other skincare products add peptides in their formula.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are wondering, why not put the protein (collagen) itself instead of these fragmented bits of
                    it that
                    will
                    then produce collagen? The answer is that long chains of a protein like collagen will not absorb
                    into your
                    skin
                    or get into the deeper, cellular levels of it, so we apply shorter bits that can get absorbed into
                    the skin
                    and
                    do the trick.
                    <br>

                the
                skin barrier, peptides help your skin strengthen in general by strengthening the proteins and connective
                tissues

                <br>

                Collagen enables your skin to look young and fresh. This is the protein that makes your skin tight,
                firm, and
                resilient. We all need a little more collagen in our lives, and we go to great lengths for it. And
                peptides
                shorten those lengths through their short amino acid chains that reach the depths of your skin and
                trigger
                collagen. Peptides not only stimulate and renew collagen but also decrease its breakdown.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, now you know why peptides have been the craze; they maintain your young, healthy, and beautiful

                you boost your collagen production with peptides, Hydration is a much-needed bonus. Moreover, peptides
                are smart
                and serve your skin where there is a need.
                <br>
                <br>

                If the peptides you applied make your skin dehydrated, it will reassemble itself to hydrate it by
                producing more
                water-retaining cells and proteins.
                <br>

                What is even more amazing is that peptides also hyaluronic acid production, the ultra-hydrating

            <p>Among the several anti-aging features peptides come with, firm and more elastic skin is one. Peptides
                keep your
                skin from going saggy and keep it intact by boosting essential proteins' production, elastin being one
                of them.

                When it comes to the cosmetic arena, the peptides are bifurcated into three broad gorups:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Signal peptides- The name says it all. These are peptides that send messages to different parts of

                    to promote proteins.<br></li><br>
                <li>Carrier peptides- The peptides that transport minerals in the skin, such as copper, boost collagen.

            <h2>What claims are legit and which are not? What does the research say about peptides?<br></h2>
            <p>The last 20 years have seen a significant growth of peptides in the anti-aging arena.<br><br>

                A 2008 study used a hydrolyzed keratin peptide and performed vivo long-term studies to evaluate the
                water
                barrier function of the skin and determine the elasticity and<a
                    href="https://beminimalist.co/collections/all/hydration">hydration</a> hydration of the skin.
                Measurements pointed out
                that keratin peptides strengthen the skin barrier, improving the skin's ability to hold water.
                <br>
                <br>
                A recent 2020 open-label study examined women aged less than or equal to 40 years with visibly photoaged
                skin
                after applying a serum with l-ascorbic acid USP (15% w/v), tocopheryl acetate USP, and five ppm
                palmitoyl
                tripeptide-38 daily for 56 days.
                <br>
                <br>

                The result is that the serum with antioxidants and matrix-restoring peptides improves skin tone,
                decreases
                redness and roughness, and improves radiance, complexion, and wrinkles.
                <br>
                <br>

                A double-blind clinical study conducted in 2004 evaluated the effect of hexapeptides on wrinkles by
                examining 20
                healthy women from age 40 to 62. They applied 3% of peptide + 1% of booster molecule gel for four weeks
                and saw
                a reduction in the length, depth, and the total surface the wrinkles covered. The study shows that the
                collagen-like peptide works deeply and intensely on wrinkles.

            <h2>How do I get started with peptides? </h2><br>
            <p>Choose a leave-on product. This will give the peptides time to work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Consider the products that you will use in conjunction with peptides in your routine. The ingredient is
                quite tolerant and works gracefully with other ingredients, but AHAs will nullify the effect of peptides
                on your skin, so avoid them.

            <h2>Some side effects <br></h2>
            <p>Unlike other ingredients and actives that boost collagen, peptides do not irritate and are generally safe
                for all skin types.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, it's not your skin sensitivity or oiliness that stops you from achieving a firm, youthful skin. It
                is you.
                <br>
                <br>

                The ingredient is also safe for pregnant women, but do check with your doctor.
                <br>
                <br>

                Although safe, certain topical products may cause skin sensitivity, rashes and itching. So, avoid opting
                for products from shady companies.
